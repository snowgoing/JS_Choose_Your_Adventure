				I bet you'd like to know. Well, I'm not tellin' so see ya later.

				Well, I'm sorry to hear that because the answer was pretty good.

	Are they looking at you?

		Do you feel uncomfortable?

			Maybe you have an anxiety disorder.

			Well, they're talking about you when you're not around so maybe you should feel a little uncomfortable.
